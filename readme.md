#Open Government Plan for The City of Philadelphia

[Executive Order 1-12](https://gist.github.com/3623582), signed by Mayor Michael Nutter in April of 2012, established a formal open data policy for the City of Philadelphia. As part of the Mayor’s Executive Order, this Open Government Plan is intended to outline specific objectives to incorporate the principles of open government into City operations and daily activities.

This plan will also provide background on the City’s open data and open government efforts to date, and will identify a series of objectives that will be pursued to institutionalize the Mayor’s vision for open government in the City of Philadelphia. 

This plan is organized into four main sections. The first will provide background information on the city’s open government efforts prior to the execution of Mayor Nutter’s Executive Order. Subsequent sections will detail specific actions in the three key areas of the Executive Order to advance the principles of open government: 1) transparency; 2) public participation, and; 3) collaboration.

A common theme throughout this plan, and in updates that will follow, is that the idea of “open government” refers to an ongoing process, rather than a final outcome.  Integrating open government practices into daily operations of the City of Philadelphia will be an area of constant refinement and improvement - we will build on our successes, learn from our failures and share with our partners in other cities.

The details outlined in this first version of the City of Philadelphia’s Open Government Plan are meant to outline the initial steps that will be employed to realize Mayor Nutter’s vision for a more open and transparent government, taking us to the one year anniversary of the Open Data Executive Order.
